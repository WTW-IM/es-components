We use a minified, isolated, CSS version of [Bootstrap 4.6 Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/) for layout needs. No JS required!

To include it in your project, add the following stylesheet reference:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ASSETS_PATH}}grid.css" />
```

Refer to the [official Bootstrap Grid documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/grid/) for usage.

We also have made the [Bootstrap 4.6 Utility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/utilities/borders/) classes optionally available. Include them with the following link:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ASSETS_PATH}}util.css" />
```
